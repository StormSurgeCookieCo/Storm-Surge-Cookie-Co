# Storm-Surge-Cookie-Co
Storm Surge Cookie Company was born on the West Coast, where rain has a rhythm and comfort comes warm from the oven. These cookies are for rainy days, salty air and slowing down with coffee in hand while beachcombing, because on the coast, the best moments happen when you lean into the storm.
